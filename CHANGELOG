Arduino NINA-W102 firmware ?.?.? - ????.??.??

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.8 - 2021.07.29

* Fix issue due to repeated status()/connected() call (#73)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.7 - 2021.06.18

Functionally identical with 1.4.6, except version number.

This release was made necessary because bad arguments were used with the FirmwareUploader tool
on Arduino Cloud for updating NINA-FWs (effectively deleting all certificates except the one
fetched by the tool). Now all Cloud-Connected NINA-FWs need to be updated once more which is
only possible by incrementing the firmware version number.

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.6 - 2021.06.09

* Add a new root certificate list including detailed instructions how to update it (#71)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.5 - 2021.05.05

* Adding support for Arduino RP2040 Nano Connect (#67)
* Added ISRG Root X1 for LetsEncrypt (#68)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.4 - 2021.04.13

* Adding support for Arduino RP2040 Nano Connect (#64)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.3 - 2021.01.29

* Do not immediately close connection after 1 failed write (#62)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.2 - 2021.01.28

Port BearSSL + crypto integration to NINA (#57). This allows to offload BearSSL for Arduino IoT Cloud applications to the nina module, drastically saving on flash/RAM.

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.1 - 2020.08.17

* Direct download of OTA binary to Nina storage and verifying both CRC and length (#53)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.0 - 2020.07.13

* Adding API which allows to utilize the nina file system as an external storage module for the host CPU (#32)
* Fixing bug leading to packet corruption in situation of high UDP traffic (#49)
* Fixing bug leading to missing packets and connection drop (#50)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.3.0 - 2019.12.23

* Fixed channel's assignement for WiFi.beginAP(...)
* Fixed set host name API begin connecting to AP
* Updated to IDF v3.3.1
* Added WPA2 Enterprise support (PEAP/MSCHAPv2 + EAP-TLS)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.4 - 2019.06.14

* Disabled CONFIG_LWIP_DHCP_DOES_ARP_CHECK
* Added small delay to WiFiUDP.parsePacket() allow other tasks to run
* Updated to esp-idf v3.3 branch

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.3 - 2018.04.09

* Added reason code command to retrieve the disconnect reason code
* WiFiSSLClient: enable SNI via mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname when using hostname

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.2 - 2018.03.26

* Changed connections to use WIFI_FAST_SCAN instead of WIFI_ALL_CHANNEL_SCAN
* Changed ASSOC_FAIL error handling, to now try to re-connect
* Added phy_init partition with u-blox recommended phy init data and use 
* Fixed socket connections hanging when WiFi is disconnected
* Fixed issues where DNS server could be reset to 0.0.0.0 on WiFi re-connections
* Updated to use esp-idf 3.1.3

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.1 - 2018.11.16

* Fixed factory SSL certificates being incorrectly parsed due to OOM caused by Bluetooth inclusion

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.0 - 2018.11.13

* Fixed DNS servers not sticking when static IP address is used
* Added HCI UART mode on boot, enabled if SS is LOW
* Erase NVS flash on init failure

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.1.0 - 2018.10.4

* WiFi is now stopped before connecting to AP
* Changed default STA hostname to "arduino-XXYY"
* Switched to all channel scan when connecting to AP in STA mode
* Fixed static IP's support in STA + AP modes
* Return failure on bad AP params
* Moved certificates to separate mmapped partition, added a larger set of built-in root CA's
* Updated to use esp-idf v3.1

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.0.0 - 2018.06.28

* Initial release
