# Arduino NINA-W102 firmware

This firmware uses [Espressif's IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

## Building

1. [Download the ESP32 toolchain](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.2/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
1. Extract it and add it to your `PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/toolchain>/bin`
1. Clone **v3.2.2** of the IDF: `git clone --branch v3.2.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
1. Set the `IDF_PATH` environment variable: `export IDF_PATH=<path/to/idf>`
1. Run `make` to build the firmware (in the directory of this read me)
1. Load the `Tools -> SerialNINAPassthrough` example sketch on to the board
1. Use `esptool` to flash the compiled firmware
